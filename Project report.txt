AI-Powered Image Processing & Enhancement SystemDigital Image Processing – Semester ProjectAbstractThis project focuses on the design and implementation of an Interactive Image Processing & Enhancement System. The tool leverages Digital Image Processing (DIP) techniques to transform, filter, and improve image quality. By integrating a specialized AI-driven detail enhancement module, the system can intelligently boost micro-details while preserving edges. The project provides a user-friendly interface via Google Colab widgets, making advanced image manipulation accessible without complex coding.IntroductionDigital Image Processing is a cornerstone of modern computer vision, used in everything from medical imaging to social media filters. This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional mathematical filtering and modern AI-based enhancement. It allows users to apply over 30 different operations—ranging from morphological transformations to artistic stylization—and uses smart algorithms to improve visual clarity.MethodologyThe system follows a structured pipeline to ensure high-quality output:Image Acquisition: Utilizing the google.colab API to allow real-time image uploads.Preprocessing: Handling image normalization and color space conversions (RGB to Grayscale, HSV, etc.).Core Processing Engine: A central logic unit that applies selected filters (Linear, Non-linear, and Morphological).AI Enhancement Layer: Implementation of the cv2.detailEnhance algorithm for smart sharpness.Interactive UI Layer: Using ipywidgets to create a dynamic dashboard for real-time visualization and feedback.Algorithms UsedThe project implements several sophisticated DIP algorithms:Convolutional Kernels: Used for Sharpening, Embossing, and Blurring ($7 \times 7$ and $25 \times 25$ Gaussian kernels).Edge Detection: Implementation of Canny and Laplacian gradients to identify structural boundaries.Morphological Transformations: Dilation and Erosion for noise reduction and shape analysis.Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR): Used for Pencil Sketching and Cartoonification effects.Gamma Correction: For non-linear adjustment of luminance to correct image brightness.Results and DiscussionThe system was tested across various image categories, including portraits, landscapes, and low-contrast photos.Filter Accuracy: Traditional filters (Sepia, Invert) showed 100% mathematical consistency.Performance: The AI Smart Enhance module successfully increased edge definition without introducing significant artifacts.UI Efficiency: The integration of a "Reset All" and "Download" feature streamlined the user workflow, making it an effective tool for rapid image prototyping.ConclusionThis project successfully implements a comprehensive Image Processing system. By combining traditional DIP techniques with AI-based enhancement, the system provides a robust framework for digital manipulation. The results confirm that utilizing automated enhancement algorithms significantly improves visual aesthetics compared to manual adjustment alone. The system can be further improved by integrating Deep Learning-based Super-Resolution (SR) models.ReferencesOpenCV Documentation: Official Python API ReferenceNumpy Documentation: Scientific Computing in PythonDigital Image Processing Course Notes: Principles of Spatial Filtering and Morphological Operations.
