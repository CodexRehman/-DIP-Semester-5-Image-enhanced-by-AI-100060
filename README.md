Project Overview: This project is an Interactive AI-Powered Image Processing System developed using Python and OpenCV to demonstrate advanced Digital Image Processing (DIP) techniques. It features a dynamic dashboard that allows users to apply over 30 different filters, including morphological transformations (Dilation/Erosion), edge detection (Canny/Laplacian), and artistic effects like Cartoonification. The standout feature is the AI Smart Enhance module, which uses non-photorealistic rendering to intelligently boost image details and clarity in real-time. By integrating Google Colab widgets, the system provides a user-friendly GUI for instant visualization, making complex image manipulation accessible and efficient.
Objective of the Project:
To Develop an Interactive DIP Framework: To create a centralized system where multiple Digital Image Processing techniques can be applied to a single image through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI).

To Implement Multi-Category Image Filtering: To integrate over 30 distinct algorithms covering color space conversions, morphological operations (Erosion/Dilation), and spatial domain filtering (Sharpen/Blur).

To Enhance Image Quality via AI Algorithms: To utilize advanced OpenCV functions like cv2.detailEnhance to intelligently improve micro-details and edge definition without introducing noise.

To Demonstrate Real-Time Image Manipulation: To provide an instant feedback loop using Google Colab widgets, allowing users to visualize the mathematical impact of different kernels and transformations immediately.

To Automate Structural and Geometric Analysis: To simplify complex tasks such as edge detection (Canny/Laplacian), rotation, and thresholding into a single-click operation for efficient image analysis.
